    """
    Decodes a cloned qubit state back into a qutrit state.
    
    The decoder is conceptually built as the tensor product of two conjugate transposes 
    of the encoder's unitary. Here, a simplified decoding operation is performed.
    
    Parameters:
        cloned_qubit_state (jnp.ndarray): A 4-dimensional vector representing the two-qubit state.
        encoder_unitary (jnp.ndarray): The 3Ã—3 unitary matrix used in the encoding process.
        
    Returns:
        jnp.ndarray: The decoded state (expected to be projected into a 3-dimensional qutrit space).
